    <p>The Highlands is one of the newest neighborhoods in the Palisades. It began as a series of tract homes, built in the hills above Sunset. It is also one of the few areas in the Palisades with condominiums and townhouses. Then in the 1990's, beautiful 2-story homes and estates were built on the northern side. This area is especially popular with families and celebrities, due to the many gated streets. Many of the homes here are large in square footage (about 3000-6000sf) and are affiliated with the exclusive Summit Club. Condos start around $700,000-$1,500,000. Homes start around $1,200,000 to $6,000,000. Homes are mainly in the Marquez Elementary district.</p>
